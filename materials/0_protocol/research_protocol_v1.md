## 2. Introduction & Problem Statement
*(To be written: Brief on AI literacy gap, need for evidence-based training.)*

## 3. Hypotheses
*   **H1 (Competency):** Students who complete the Promptcraft Academy intervention will demonstrate a significantly higher score on a practical AI task rubric than students in the control group.
*   **H2 (Self-Efficacy):** The intervention group will show a greater increase in AI self-efficacy scores from pre-test to post-test compared to the control group.
*   **H3 (Ethics):** The intervention group will demonstrate superior ability to identify ethical risks in AI use cases in a post-test scenario analysis.

## 4. Methodology
