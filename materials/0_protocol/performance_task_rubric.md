# Performance Task & Scoring Rubric - v1.0

## Task Instruction (Given to Participant):
"You will be provided with a short, dense research abstract from the field of [e.g., Sustainable Technology]. **Your goal:** Use any AI tool you prefer (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, etc.) to:
1.  **Generate a 250-word summary** suitable for an undergraduate student with no background in the field.
2.  **Extract the three (3) core arguments** made by the authors.
3.  **Propose two (2) insightful, critical questions** you would ask the authors based on their abstract.

**You must submit:**
*   Your final answers for 1, 2, and 3.
*   A complete transcript of all prompts you used and the AI's responses."

## Scoring Rubric

| Criterion | Poor (0 pts) | Satisfactory (1 pt) | Good (2 pts) | Excellent (3 pts) | **Max Score** |
|-----------|--------------|---------------------|--------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **A. Summary Accuracy & Clarity** | Summary is missing, completely inaccurate, or copied verbatim. | Captures <50% of main points; language is technical or unclear. | Captures most main points; language is mostly clear for a layperson. | Accurately captures the thesis & all key points in clear, accessible language. | **3** |
| **B. Argument Extraction Completeness** | Fails to identify core arguments. | Identifies 1 correct argument. | Identifies 2 correct arguments. | Correctly identifies all 3 core arguments. | **3** |
| **C. Prompt Sophistication** | Single, vague prompt (e.g., "summarize this"). | Uses basic structure (Role/Context). | Uses one advanced pattern (e.g., Chain-of-Thought, Persona). | Uses multiple advanced patterns and shows clear iterative refinement. | **3** |
| **D. Ethical & Procedural Rigor** | No prompts submitted; uses AI output verbatim without note. | Submits prompts; uses AI output with minimal attribution. | Clearly attributes AI use; attempts verification (e.g., "check this fact"). | Explicitly cites AI use; describes verification steps; flags potential biases/limitations. | **3** |
| | | | | | **Total:** **12** |
