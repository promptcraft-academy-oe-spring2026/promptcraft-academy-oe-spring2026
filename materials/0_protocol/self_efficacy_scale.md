# AI Self-Efficacy Scale (AISES) - v1.0
**Instructions:** Please rate your confidence in performing the following tasks using AI tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, or Copilot. Use the scale: 
**1=Not at all confident, 2=Slightly confident, 3=Moderately confident, 4=Very confident, 5=Extremely confident.**

| # | Statement | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|---|-----------|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | I can write a prompt that gets an AI to summarize a long, complex article for a report. |   |   |   |   |   |
| 2 | I can use AI to brainstorm and refine creative ideas for a project. |   |   |   |   |   |
| 3 | I can instruct an AI to help debug or explain errors in a piece of code. |   |   |   |   |   |
| 4 | I can design a prompt that makes an AI adopt a specific expert persona (e.g., a marketing strategist, a research scientist). |   |   |   |   |   |
| 5 | I can use AI to analyze a dataset (e.g., in a CSV file) to find trends or answer specific questions. |   |   |   |   |   |
| 6 | I can iteratively refine a prompt based on an AI's initial output to get a better result. |   |   |   |   |   |
| 7 | I can identify when an AI's output might be factually incorrect or a "hallucination." |   |   |   |   |   |
| 8 | I can use AI to help plan and break down a complex multi-step project. |   |   |   |   |   |
| 9 | I understand how to use AI in a way that is ethical and avoids plagiarism in an academic setting. |   |   |   |   |   |
|10 | I feel confident I can learn to use new AI tools and features as they become available. |   |   |   |   |   |

**Scoring:** Sum of all responses (Range: 10-50). Higher score indicates higher self-efficacy.
